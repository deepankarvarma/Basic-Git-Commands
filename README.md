Commands related to a remote repository:<br>
        `git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git`<br>
        `git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)`<br><br>
Commands related to the workflow:<br>
        `git add .`<br>
        `git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"`<br><br>
Commands related to checking status or log history<br>
        `git status`<br>
        `git log`<br>
<br>
The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,
<br>
`git add .` is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;<br>
`git commit -m "message"` is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and<br>
`git status` is read as git | status | (no destination).<br>
